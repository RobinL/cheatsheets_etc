### Installation of packrat:

Had problems on Windows.  Solved them by completely uninstalling R, R Studio and RTools, and reinstalling from scratch. I did this in C:/ root rather than in C:/Program Files because of comments on the internet that this may make a difference.

When prompted by RTools, you want to change the Windows registry and your PATH variables.


### How packrat seems to work:

Used in combination with Github, it relies on the sha1 of the commit to identify a version. It doesn't seem to care about tags or releases within github.  It takes the sha1 of the most recent commit to master and it takes the version information from whatever's filled out in 'description.'
